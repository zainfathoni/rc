# Task 4

## Solution

1. Mock the API response with MSW (Mock Service Worker) to test the UI
   components without relying on the actual API.
2. Write tests for the UI components using Vitest and Vue Testing Library.
3. Once we have a reliable test suite, we can refactor the code from
   [Vue's Options API to Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles)
   with confidence.
